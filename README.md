# Developer CV - Jack Bridger

I have a Masters in Civil Engineering, and I enjoy solving real world problems using applied mathematics. During my degree I was introduced to programming and taught myself C#. After my degree I joined the Founders & Coders co-operative where I learnt web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Node.js. When the  course finished I was involved in launching its agency division, and began teaching as  well as working as a developer.

I have a Masters in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Management. I am passionate about solving real problems by understanding customer challenges and then using great technology and design to address these. 

At Founders & Coders I've hugely enjoyed developing a deeper understanding of JavaScript and frameworks such as React as well as working in teams to build products. 

I have also had the opportunity to further refine my ability to conduct customer research, build prototypes and iterate based on customer feedback. 

Prior to my time as a developer I have worked closely with customers and product development whilst founding Code at Uni, working at Stack Overflow in sales and at a startup as the first business development hire.
